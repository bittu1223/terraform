How to install Jenkins Master Node to Slave Node

Here are the commands used in this lesson's demo. They were run on the slave node:

sudo yum -y install git java-1.8.0-openjdk
sudo useradd -d /var/lib/jenkins jenkins
ssh-keygen
As ssh-keygen prompts you, just hit enter for each one to select the defaults.

Next, read the file with the public key and copy its contents to your clipboard:

cat /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Now we've got to make a .ssh directory for the jenkins user, and create an autorized_keys file in there:

sudo mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
sudo vi /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys
Paste the contents of id_rsa.pub into authorized_keys and save the file.

We created the directory and file with sudo, and jenkins is who needs to actually own it. Lets' fix that:

sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
Now, we the contents of the file with private key:

cat /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa
